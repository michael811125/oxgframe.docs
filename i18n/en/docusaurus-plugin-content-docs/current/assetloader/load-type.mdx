## Loading via Resources

<Highlight color="#00d679">Reminder</Highlight> When using Resources loading, no additional configuration is required. Simply place the assets under the Resources folder and load them directly by using the **res#** prefix followed by the asset path.

<Highlight color="#ff2f00">Important</Highlight> Using the **res#** prefix will switch to the Resources loading method.

```csharp
// res# prefix
AssetLoaders.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("res#MyPrefabs/Cube");
```

## Loading via AssetBundle

### Step 1.

You must first configure it through the YooAsset Collector.

<Highlight color="#0373fc">Attention</Highlight> Pay attention to the addressable names â€” in the example image, the DefaultPackage includes an addressable named Cube.

### Step 2.

When developing with AssetBundle, you also need to configure **PatchLauncher** for Runtime. This is required because when using AssetBundle loading, relevant initialization configurations are needed.

<Highlight color="#0373fc">Attention</Highlight> Drag it into the Hierarchy window after importing.

### Step 3.

Configure the default Packages, which will be initialized at Runtime.
- Default App Packages.
- Default DLC Packages.

![](/img/assetloader/latest/img_8.png)

<Highlight color="#ff2f00">Important</Highlight> The default Packages will be managed and checked by the **main downloader**, so Packages not included in the defaults must be initialized manually through the API, as described below.

App Package
```csharp
// [Load asset and download from specific package (Export App Bundles for CDN)]

AppPackageInfoWithBuild packageInfo = new AppPackageInfoWithBuild()
{
    buildMode = BundleConfig.BuildMode.ScriptableBuildPipeline,
    packageName = "OtherPackage"
};

bool isInitialized = await AssetPatcher.InitAppPackage(packageInfo, true);
if (isInitialized)
    await AssetLoaders.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("packageName", "assetName");
```

DLC Package
```csharp
// [Load asset and download from specific package (Export Individual DLC Bundles for CDN)]

DlcPackageInfoWithBuild packageInfo = new DlcPackageInfoWithBuild()
{
    buildMode = BundleConfig.BuildMode.ScriptableBuildPipeline,
    packageName = "DlcPackage",
    dlcVersion = "dlcVersion",
    withoutPlatform = false
};

bool isInitialized = await AssetPatcher.InitDlcPackage(packageInfo, true);
if (isInitialized)
    await AssetLoaders.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("packageName", "assetName");
```

<Highlight color="#0373fc">Attention</Highlight> Distinguish between App Packages and DLC Packages, noting the different paths.
- App Packages
  - The path follows the main program version (.../CDN/\<ProductName\>/\<Platform\>/\<AppVersion\>/\<PackageName\>).
  - Manual initialization of AssetPatcher.InitAppPackage is required (if autoUpdate = false, you will need to manually call AssetPatcher.UpdatePackage to update the Manifest).
- DLC Packages
  - The path includes the platform (.../CDN/\<ProductName\>/\<Platform\>/DLC/\<PackageName\>/\<DlcVersion\>).
  - The path does not include the platform (.../CDN/\<ProductName\>/DLC/\<PackageName\>/\<DlcVersion\>), **which is a shared resource for all platforms**.
  - Supports downloading specific versions of DLC packages and DLC package uninstallation. You must manually call AssetPatcher.InitDlcPackage and specify a specific dlcVersion. The dlcVersion can also be set to a fixed version (e.g., "latest"), so whenever the DLC is updated, you can use a fixed path for the update.

<Highlight color="#0373fc">Attention</Highlight> Additionally, the Play Mode descriptions are as follows:
- Editor Simulate Mode (Development Mode).
- Offline Mode.
- Host Mode.
- Weak Host Mode.
- WebGL Mode.
- WebGL Remote Mode.

### Step 4.

Once the preliminary setup is complete and the main configuration process is initialized -> AssetPatcher.IsInitialized(), you can begin loading as follows.

Load the object with the addressable name "Cube" from the DefaultPackage.
```csharp
AssetLoaders.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>("DefaultPackage", "Cube");
```

> <Highlight color="#0373fc">Note</Highlight> Additionally, the sequence of the process is as follows:
> - Poll the initialization state `AssetPatcher.IsInitialized() == true` -> then you can <Highlight color="#ff2f00">load built-in resources</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#ff2f00">perform update checks</Highlight>.
> - Perform update check `AssetPatcher.Check()` -> Poll the completion state `AssetPatcher.IsDone() == true` -> After the update is completed -> you can <Highlight color="#ff2f00">load updated resources</Highlight>.
